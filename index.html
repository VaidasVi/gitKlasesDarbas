                <p>Newton was an English
                    physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher,
                    alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential men in human
                    history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published
                    in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the
                    history of science.</p>

          Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of
          relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the
          equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
          “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his
          discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

                Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as
                the most important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man who
                “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many
                revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism
                in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
